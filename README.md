# About

This api is been built as an job selection process for a brazilian insurance company

## Insurance Api

This api was built with the [swagger editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) and [swagger maven plugin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmfCS1E7oeI&t=86s).

Due to unespected delays in other commitments, I was unable to consume the [Insurance Manager Dependency](https://github.com/RobertoMessaBrasil/test-brazilianinsurancecompany-dep-insurancemanager) in this api.

### Next steps:
1. override the post verb and use the Insurance Manager Inbound adapter to create a customer
2. override the get by id verb and use the Insurance Manager Inbound adapter to retrieve a customer
